# thecraftlab.io

A minimalist dracula-themed personal site built with React and Vite.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the site for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Content Management

Place markdown files in `src/content/<section>/`. The following sections are supported:

- `whoami`: personal bio files
- `courses`: course descriptions
- `articles`: blog posts

New markdown files in these folders will automatically load in the site once added.
